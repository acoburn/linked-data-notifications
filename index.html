                          <p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications. The data contained within a notification is arbitrary, and typically only usable by the application which generated it in the first place. In the spirit of Linked Data, we propose that notifications should be reusable by multiple applications. This provides end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be used in combination. Through separating out the concepts of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em> of notifications, and leveraging Linked Data principles of shared vocabularies and URIs for resources, the Linked Data Notifications (LDN) protocol meets this goal. In this article we describe the protocol, which is a Candidate Recommendation of the W3C (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a>), situate it alongside related initiatives, and discuss additional considerations arising from architectures such as this which decouple applications from data storage. We evaluate the protocol's effectiveness through multiple, independent implementations which pass a suite of formal tests and can be demonstrated interoperating with each other.

                            <p about="" id="problem" rel="schema:hasPart">Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications. <span class="todo">put some specific, vivid examples here</span> The notification data may be displayed to a human to acknowledge, or used to trigger some other application-specific process (or both). This data is arbitrary and typically only usable by the application which generated it in the first place. Current efforts towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web [http://crosscloud.org/2016/www-mansour-pdf.pdf, http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj201_4.pdf, https://unhosted.org/, cite] are moving towards architectures in which data storage is decoupled from application logic, freeing end users to switch between applications, or to let multiple applications operate over the same data. So far, notifications are considered to be ephemeral resources which may disappear after transport, and thus are excluded from being reusable data.</p>

                            <p>We contend that notification data should no more be locked into particular systems than other user data, and designed the protocol <em>Linked Data Notifications (LDN)</em> to support sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated or what their contents are. Specifying this architecture as a formal protocol is intended to allow applications which generate and make use of notifications, which are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, to seamlessly work together. LDN contributes to decentralisation of our interactions on the Web, as well as encouraging generation and consumption of Linked Data.</p>

                            <p>We build on existing W3C standards and Linked Data principles. In particular, storage of notifications is compatible with <cite>Linked Data Platform</cite> servers, notifications are identified by HTTP URIs, and notification contents must be available as JSON-LD (and optionally negotiated for the other formats). LDN is a Candidate <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Recommendation</a> of the W3C, and incorporated in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a></cite>, a W3C Candidate Recommendation for decentralised social networking protocol based upon the <cite>ActivityStreams 2.0</cite> data format.</p>

                            <p>In this article we present use cases for decentralised notifications from the Social Web domain, and describe the requirements which guided the development of the protocol. We discuss related work in terms of predecessors to this work, comparisons with current alternative approaches, as well as complementary protocols which can work alongside LDN. We summarise the protocol itself, and then go into detail about specific architectural considerations that were made. We built a test suite which can be used to confirm that implementations conform with the specification, and we describe the independent implementations which interoperate with each other so far.</p>

                            <p>In this section we discuss some considerations for a Web notification protocol that conforms to the Linked Data design principles, as well as best practices for applications. We use the considerations towards establishing normative requirements for the protocol; what to be expected from the core for interoperable application behaviour, as well as notification data exchange.</p>

                                    <p>We propose a RESTful architecture [<a class="ref" href=""></a>], in the same way as the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification [<a class="ref" href=""></a>]. This is well suited for notifications, as REST involves organisation of atomic resources, their discovery and description, and a lightweight API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting them [<a href="http://ws-rest.org/2011/proc/a5-page.pdf">LD&amp;REST</a>]. As such, notifications are considered resources in their own right, with their own dereferencable URIs.</p>
                                    <p>A further advantage of this is that existing LDP servers can be used to store notifications, as new notifications can be created in a <code>Container</code> in exactly the same way as any other resource.</p>
                                    <p>In order to encourage modularity of applications, it is important to differentiate between different classes of implementation of the protocol. Two parties are involved in the creation of a notification: a <em>sender</em> which has deemed it necessary to generate notification data, and a <em>receiver</em> which stores the created resource. For notifications to be reused, we also have the role of a <em>consumer</em>, which reads the data of the notification and repurposes it to some end.</p>
                                    <p>A piece of software can of course play two or all three of these roles; the important part is that it need not. A consuming application can read and use notification data without being concerned about ever sending or storing notifications itself.</p>

                                    <p>Linked Data applications can benefit from domain-driven designs; that is, working to be small and focussed on a particular purpose, rather than generic or catch-all. We do not purport to be able to design a notifications ontology which is appropriate for every domain, and so we consider the contents of a notification to be <em>application specific</em>. We derive two core principles from this:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>a notification can contain arbitrary data</li>
                                        <li>a notification is vocabulary agnostic</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Interoperability between different applications occurs through vocabulary reuse, and shared understanding of terms. This is in accordance with Linked Data principles in general. The practical upshot of this is that a calendar application which consumes event invitations which use the <em>vCalendar</em> (? is this right?) vocabulary is likely to completely ignore notifications containing scientific experiment results in the <em><a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/MEX.html">MEX</a></em> vocabulary, even if it finds them all stored in the same place. For two independent applications operating in the <em>same</em> domain, a shared understanding of appropriate vocabulary terms is assumed.</p>

                                    <p>Setting constraints on notification data shape is motivated with the purpose of attaining application and data integrity.

For <em>data integrity</em>, constraints makes it possible to store and serve data as intended, as well as optimal reuse by different conforming applications, and play a key role in accuracy and consistency in data's life-cycle.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Persistence and Preservation</strong>: There is a social expectation to ensure the persistence of identifiers for the notifications, and that they are preserved for long term. The are generally two aspects to persistence: 1) well-designed URIs, and 2) the management of URIs. The diversity in applications would mean that different <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570">URI Templates</a> will emerge for inboxes as well as notifications. Closely related but orthogonal to persistence is the preservation of these identifiers and their descriptions (resolveability) for long term. For instance, applications may have additional interest in referring, consuming, or reusing notifications, e.g., if they are cached, or expected to be time specific. To this end, additional archival methods may need to be incorporated for each inbox and notification state, and eventually be discoverable and resolving. [<a href="http://philarcher.org/diary/2013/uripersistence/">, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers" title="Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets"></a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089"></a>]</p>

                                    <p><strong>License</strong>: In order to promote fair use or remixing of the notifications, the rights and license information should be accompanied. Similarly, applications that generate or store notifications may include additional information on license of the resources that are referred from the notification. The presence of this type of information is essential for consumers to assess the usability of data.</p>

                                    <p>Here we review previous and ongoing efforts towards delivering notifications in a decentralised manner. Since many systems which make use of notifications operate either in a completely centralised way, or are decentralised only in the sense that different instances of the <em>same</em> codebase need to interoperate, there appears to be limited work to review.</p>

                                    <p>The contents of a notification is one of either: 1) URLs, indicating relations between Web resources, or 2) a 'fat ping' containing a blob of information. Semantic Pingback, Webmention, and Provenance Pingback follow the first form, and are also known as <cite>linkbacks</cite>, the suite of protocols that essentially allows Web documents to manually and automatically link to or mention one another. This has the advantage that a verification mechanism can be tightly specified (the URL of the target must appear in the content of the source), but the disadvantage that notifications are only available for the use case of a link being published on the Web.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Semantic Pingback</strong> [<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~auer/publication/SemanticPingback.pdf"></a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Pingback&oldid=57876"></a>, <a href="https://aksw.github.io/SemanticPingback/"></a>] and <strong>Webmention</strong> [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention"></a>] both update the original Pingback [<a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback"></a>] mechanism by replacing the XML-RPC transport mechanism by a <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> request with two parameters (<code>source</code> and <code>target</code>). They both also replace the <code>X-Pingback</code> HTTP header with a <code>Link</code> relation, either in HTTP or HTML, for discovery of the respective receiving service. Semantic Pingback further enables discovery of the Pingback service where source resources are available as RDF. While the content at source may indicate (in any convention or serialisation format) the type of relation between the source and target URLs, the information about the relation is not transmitted to the receiver's endpoint, and nor is there a way to distinguish between multiple potential mentions of the target; this is left up to the receiver to interpret. Semantic Pingback does encourage generation of additional semantics about the relation(s) between the source and the target by processing the source as RDF if possible, and also defines specific ways for a receiving server to handle incoming pingback data in order to add the source data to an RDF knowledge base. Beyond verification, Webmention does not specify any further requirements of the receiving server; it is not expected that "mentions" are retrievable once they have been sent. </p>

                                    <p>Semantic Pingback was implemented into OntoWiki [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj201_4.pdf] and as part of the <em>Structured Feedback</em> suite of tools [http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2016/papers/LDOW2016_paper_02.pdf]. Webmention senders and receivers have been independently implemented as part of libraries, into blogging platforms such as Wordpress and Known, and as part of several personal websites or blogs [https://webmention.net/implementation-reports/summary/].</p>-->

                                    <p id="provenance-pingback">A <strong>Provenance Pingback</strong> endpoint is also advertised through an HTTP Link header, and accepts a list of URIs for provenance records describing uses of the resource [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-aq/#provenance-pingback"></a>]. Provenance Pingback does not specify any further behaviour by the receiving server, but the contents of the URIs listed in the notification body are well-defined.</p>

                                    <p>There are also notification mechanisms which send more information than just URLs in the notification body; due to each mechanism's focused use case, the payload is restricted to a particular vocabulary.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>DSNotify</strong> is a centralised service which crawls Linked Datasets and tracks changes to links (create, remove, move, update) with the specific use case of preserving link integrity between Linked Open Data resources. Notifications of changes are delivered to subscribers in the form of a specific XML payload [<a href="http://eprints.cs.univie.ac.at/81/1/2010_WWW_DSNotify.pdf"></a>, <a href="http://www.cibiv.at/~niko/dsnotify/"></a>]. Alternatively, with the <strong>sparqlPuSH</strong> service, users may indicate specific updates to a dataset they are interested in via a SPARQL query. The query is run periodically by the service, and the results are converted to an XML feed, which is sent to a PubSubHubbub hub to which the user can subscribe [<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-699/Paper6.pdf"></a>]. The <strong>ResourceSync Change Notification</strong> specification also sends update notifications via a PubSubHubbub hub, this time with an XML payload based on the Sitemap format [<a class="ref" href="http://www.openarchives.org/rs/notification/1.0/notification"></a>].</p>

                            <p><dfn id="ldn">Linked Data Notifications (<abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>)</dfn> is a protocol that describes how servers (receivers) can have messages pushed to them by applications (senders), as well as how other applications (consumers) may retrieve those messages. Any resource can advertise a receiving endpoint (Inbox) for the messages. Messages are expressed in RDF, and can contain any data.</p>

                            <p>LDN is a specialized use of Linked Data Platform [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ldp">LDP</a></cite>] for sending and consuming notifications. It is not dependent on a complete implementation of LDP, but an easy-to-implement subset. LDN is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn">W3C Recommendation</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ldn">LDN</a></cite>]</p>

                            <p>The LDN protocol supports a modular approach to creating and storing data, in particular a decoupling between applications and data storage. Thus, where senders, receivers and consumers of notifications are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, this protocol allows them to seamlessly work together.</p>

                                    <p>A sender is triggered, either by a human or an automatic process, to deliver a notification to a server. The notification is data intended for the attention of the receiver, for example: a personal message from a friend; a pingback link; a comment on a blog post; an invitation to collaborate; a calendar reminder; a scientific observation.</p>

                                    <p>The sender chooses a target resource to send notifications to; the sender then discovers the location of the target‚Äôs <em>Inbox</em>, and sends the notification there. Any resource can advertise an Inbox. The receiver exposes the notification data (according to appropriate access control) for use by consumers.</p>

                                    <p>Consumers discover the location of the Inbox in the same way as the sender, and may perform further processing on the notifications, combine it with some other data, or simply present it in a suitable human-readable way.</p>

                                    <p>While the ability for applications to generate payload, conduct <em>content negotiation</em>, and consume content in all W3C RDF serializations, has advantages to be flexible, it can be costly to support across applications. From the perspective of the protocol's design, there are some considerations to take into account, for example:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>application interoperability</li>
                                        <li>maintenance of the RDF parsers and serialisation libraries</li>
                                        <li>complexity of their inclusion in applications</li>
                                        <li>run-time efficiency</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>With the goal of enabling simple yet interoperable application creation, LDN requires applications to speak and understand the JSON-LD syntax ‚Äî for looking at the contents of Inbox as well as individual notifications. Applications are permitted to optionally negotiate different RDF serialisations among themselves.</p>

                                    <p>The rationale for this is that, if all applications can work with one serialisation, then they are interoperable. Applications that are capable of or wish to handle different serialisations are able to coexist in this ecosystem nevertheless. The benefit to making JSON-LD is that it provides the lowest barrier for applications to communicate. While the same can be said for any RDF serialisation, JSON-LD is arguably more convenient to work with than the other serialisations in client-side implementations.</p>

                            <p><strong>Target ownership</strong>: Publishers of the resources advertising an Inbox (target) should do so on a server they trust. Publishers must be aware that third-party access to headers or content could result in notifications being redirected.</p>

                            <p><strong>Natural Language Content</strong>: Building an international base of users is important in a federated network. Some LDN interactions can return content with natural language text, such as HTML fragments, or summary fields. Providing multiple language representations of each item might not be feasible in all circumstances. Implementations are encouraged to provide means of discovering the available languages and/or negotiating the language returned, such as using the HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header to negotiate and select the most appropriate language representation to send for a given request.</p>
