                          <p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications. The data contained within a notification is arbitrary, and typically only usable by the application which generated it in the first place. In the spirit of Linked Data, we propose that notifications should be reusable by multiple applications. This provides end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be used in combination. Through separating out the concepts of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em> of notifications, and leveraging Linked Data principles of shared vocabularies and URIs for resources, the Linked Data Notifications (LDN) protocol meets this goal. In this article we describe the protocol, which is a Candidate Recommendation of the W3C (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a>), situate it alongside related initiatives, and discuss additional considerations arising from architectures such as this which decouple applications from data storage. We evaluate the protocol's effectiveness through multiple, independent implementations which pass a suite of formal tests and can be demonstrated interoperating with each other.

                            <p about="" id="problem" rel="schema:hasPart">Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications. <span class="todo">put some specific, vivid examples here</span> The notification data may be displayed to a human to acknowledge, or used to trigger some other application-specific process (or both). This data is arbitrary and typically only usable by the application which generated it in the first place. Current efforts towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web [cite, cite] are moving towards architectures in which data storage is decoupled from application logic, freeing end users to switch between applications, or to let multiple applications operate over the same data. So far, notifications are considered to be ephemeral resources which may disappear after transport, and thus are excluded from being reusable data.</p>

                            <p>We contend that notification data should no more be locked into particular systems than other user data, and designed the protocol <em>Linked Data Notifications (LDN)</em> to support sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated or what their contents are. Specifying this architecture as a formal protocol is intended to allow applications which generate and make use of notifications, which are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, to seamlessly work together. LDN contributes to decentralisation of our interactions on the Web, as well as encouraging generation and consumption of Linked Data.</p>

                            <p>We build on existing W3C standards and Linked Data principles. In particular, storage of notifications is compatible with <cite>Linked Data Platform</cite> servers, notifications are identified by HTTP URIs, and notification contents must be available as JSON-LD (and optionally negotiated for the other formats). LDN is a Candidate <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Recommendation</a> of the W3C, and incorporated in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a></cite>, a W3C Candidate Recommendation for decentralised social networking protocol based upon the <cite>ActivityStreams 2.0</cite> data format.</p>

                            <p>In this article we present user cases for decentralised notifications from the Social Web domain, and describe the requirements which guided the development of the protocol. We discuss related work in terms of predecessors to this work, comparisons with current alternative approaches, as well as complementary protocols which can work alongside LDN. We summarise the protocol itself, and then go into detail about specific architectural considerations that were made. We built a test suite which can be used to confirm that implementations conform with the specification, and we describe the independent implementations which interoperate with each other so far.</p>

Since many systems which make use of notifications operate either in a completely centralised way, or are decentralised only in the sense that different instances of the <em>same</em> codebase need to interoperate, there appears to be limited work to review. We focus primarily on the well known mechanisms <em>Semantic Pingback</em> and <em>Webmention</em>, both of which are derived from blogging-era <em>Pingback</em>. We also touch upon several mechanisms specifically designed for notifications regarding Linked Data resources or sets.</p>

                                            <p>The Webmention protocol is used to notify that content at the source URL includes the target URL <em>string</em> to the receiver of a Webmention endpoint.</p>

                                            <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/#sender-notifies-receiver">
                                                <p>The sender <strong class="rfc2119">MUST</strong> post <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> [<cite>HTML5</cite>] <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> parameters to the Webmention endpoint, where <code>source</code> is the URL of the sender's page containing a link, and <code>target</code> is the URL of the page being linked to.</p>
                                            </blockquote>

                                            <p>Webmention does not define the notion of an entity that is accessible at an URL for the mention itself. The mention is only intended for the receiver to process. There are no syntactical restrictions set on the content of the source URL, e.g., it can be plain-text, HTML, JSON, or a binary file, therefore it is effectively foremost about the source URL containing the target URL as a string.</p>

                                            <p id="webmention-workflow">A Webmention workflow is as follows: 1) Alice has an article in-reply-to Bob's article, 2) Bob's Webmention endpoint is discovered to deliver a mention, 3) a Webmention is sent to Bob's endpoint indicating that Alice's <em>mentions</em> Bob's article.</p>

                                            <p id="webmention-scope-and-approach"><strong>Scope and Approach</strong>: The <em>source</em> URL is the most essential component since it identifies the origin of the claim and where to locate it. Since the information that is provided in the <code>POST</code> is only a claim, it may or may not be of interest to the receiver, and the receiver makes no promise to do anything with it e.g., displaying.</p>

                                            <p>The <em>target</em> URL is used for the purpose of optimisation, i.e., making it easier for the recipient to find the target URL string at the source URL. The target URL is also used to allow external (third-party) services to help site owners without a Webmention endpoint.</p>

                                            <p id="webmention-analysis"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Verification of Webmention claims in source formats that's in plain-text or binary are ambiguous due to unspecified characteristic of where an URL string starts and ends. Hence, exact matching the string URL is not deterministic as there may be partial matches which are false positives. For structured formats like HTML and JSON, it has inherent limitations given that:</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>While the content at source may indicate (in any convention or serialisation format) the type of relation between the source and target URLs, the information about the relation is not transmitted to the receiver's endpoint. Hence, the receiver implementation <em>interprets</em> the relation (or lack of) between the source and the target. The untyped relation is interpreted as a generic <em>mention</em> by default.</li>

                                                <li>If the source URL contains multiple mentions of the target URL, the Webmention endpoint is not informed about the particular instance. Therefore, the receiver is required to process the whole document and base its verification on the existence of one of those mentions. This sets forth an indeterministic verification step since there is no clear way to distinguish the received Webmention at the endpoint from multiple mentions which can exist at the source.</li>

                            <p>Inboxes are repositories for notifications.</p>

                            <p>Notifications are intended to announce social interactions and data.</p>

                            <p>The contents of a notification is application specific. We derive two core principles from this:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>a notification can contain arbitrary data</li>
                                <li>a notification is vocabulary agnostic</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Notifications are resources with their own URIs... (not ephemeral)</p>

                            <p>---</p>

                            <p><dfn id="ldn">Linked Data Notifications (<abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>)</dfn> is a protocol that describes how servers (receivers) can have messages pushed to them by applications (senders), as well as how other applications (consumers) may retrieve those messages. Any resource can advertise a receiving endpoint (Inbox) for the messages. Messages are expressed in RDF, and can contain any data.</p>

                            <p>LDN is a specialized use of Linked Data Platform [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ldp">LDP</a></cite>] for sending and consuming notifications. It is not dependent on a complete implementation of LDP, but an easy-to-implement subset. LDN is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn">W3C Recommendation</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ldn">LDN</a></cite>]</p>

                            <p>The LDN protocol supports a modular approach to creating and storing data, in particular a decoupling between applications and data storage. Thus, where senders, receivers and consumers of notifications are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, this protocol allows them to seamlessly work together.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>This specification enables the notion of a notification as an individual entity with its own URI which can be retrieved and reused.</li>
                                <li>This specification deliberately does not define the vocabulary of the notification contents in order to allow for use in a range of different application domains.</li>
                                <li>Authentication and verification of notifications is encouraged, but the mechanism to do so is at the discretion of receivers and consumers, as needs differ according to types of notification and different application domains.</li>
                            </ul>

                                    <p>A sender is triggered, either by a human or an automatic process, to deliver a notification to a server. The notification is data intended for the attention of the receiver, for example: a personal message from a friend; a pingback link; a comment on a blog post; an invitation to collaborate; a calendar reminder; a scientific observation.</p>

                                    <p>The sender chooses a target resource to send notifications to; the sender then discovers the location of the target‚Äôs <em>Inbox</em>, and sends the notification there. Any resource can advertise an Inbox. The receiver exposes the notification data (according to appropriate access control) for use by consumers.</p>

                                    <p>Consumers discover the location of the Inbox in the same way as the sender, and may perform further processing on the notifications, combine it with some other data, or simply present it in a suitable human-readable way.</p>

                                    <p>While the ability for applications to generate payload, conduct <em>content negotiation</em>, and consume content in all W3C RDF serializations, has advantages to be flexible, it can be costly to support across applications. From the perspective of the protocol's design, there are some considerations to take into account, for example:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>application interoperability</li>
                                        <li>maintenance of the RDF parsers and serialisation libraries</li>
                                        <li>complexity of their inclusion in applications</li>
                                        <li>run-time efficiency</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>With the goal of enabling simple yet interoperable application creation, LDN requires applications to speak and understand the JSON-LD syntax ‚Äî for looking at the contents of Inbox as well as individual notifications. Applications are permitted to optionally negotiate different RDF serialisations among themselves.</p>

                                    <p>The rationale for this is that, if all applications can work with one serialisation, then they are interoperable. Applications that are capable of or wish to handle different serialisations are able to coexist in this ecosystem nevertheless. The benefit to making JSON-LD is that it provides the lowest barrier for applications to communicate. While the same can be said for any RDF serialisation, JSON-LD is arguably more convenient to work with than the other serialisations in client-side implementations.</p>

                            <p><strong>Target ownership</strong>: Publishers of the resources advertising an Inbox (target) should do so on a server they trust. Publishers must be aware that third-party access to headers or content could result in notifications being redirected.</p>

                            <p><strong>Natural Language Content</strong>: Building an international base of users is important in a federated network. Some LDN interactions can return content with natural language text, such as HTML fragments, or summary fields. Providing multiple language representations of each item might not be feasible in all circumstances. Implementations are encouraged to provide means of discovering the available languages and/or negotiating the language returned, such as using the HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header to negotiate and select the most appropriate language representation to send for a given request.</p>
