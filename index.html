                          <p>In this article we describe the Linked Data Notifications (LDN) protocol, which is a Candidate Recommendation of the W3C (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a>).
                          Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, for example, by social applications. 
						  The data contained within a notification is structured arbitrarily, and typically only usable by the application which generated it in the first place.
						  In the spirit of Linked Data, we propose that notifications should be reusable by multiple authorised applications.
						  Through separating the concepts of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em> of notifications, and leveraging Linked Data principles of shared vocabularies and URIs, LDN provides a building block for decentralised Web applications. This permits end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be used in combination. 
						  We situate LDN alongside related initiatives, and discuss additional considerations such as security and abuse prevention measures. 
						  We evaluate the protocol's effectiveness with multiple, independent implementations, which pass a suite of formal tests and can be demonstrated interoperating with each other.

							<p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications: <q>You have been invited to a graduation party!</q>, <q>Tim commented on your blog post!</q>, <q>Somebody searched for you and is now following your profile</q>, <q>Liz tagged you in a photo</q>.
							The notification data may be displayed to a human to acknowledge, or used to trigger some other application-specific process (or both). 
                            In a decentralised architecture, notifications can be a key element for federation of information, and application integration.
							However in centralised systems which prevail today, this data is structured arbitrarily and typically only usable by the application that generated it in the first place.
							Current efforts towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web [<a href="http://crosscloud.org/2016/www-mansour-pdf.pdf"></a>, <a href="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj201_4.pdf"></a>, <a href="https://unhosted.org/"></a>] are moving towards architectures in which data storage is decoupled from application logic, freeing end users from switch between applications, or to let multiple applications operate over the same data.
							So far, notifications are considered to be <em>ephemeral</em> resources which may disappear after transport, and thus are excluded from being designed for reuse.</p>

                            <p>We argue that notification data should not be locked into particular systems. We designed the protocol <em>Linked Data Notifications (LDN)</em> to support sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated or what their contents are. 
							We describe how the principles of identification, addressability and semantic representation can be applied to notifications on the Web.
							Specifying LDN as a formal protocol allows independently implemented, heterogeneous applications which generate and use notifications, to seamlessly work together. 
							Thus, LDN supports the decentralisation of the Web as well as encourages the generation and consumption of Linked Data.</p>

                            <p>We build on existing W3C standards and Linked Data principles. 
							In particular, the storage of notifications is compatible with the <cite>Linked Data Platform</cite> standard; notifications are identified by HTTP URIs; and notification contents must be available as JSON-LD.
							A key architectural decision is the separation of concerns between <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> of notifications. 
							Implementations of the protocol can play one or more of these roles, and interoperate successfully with implementations playing the complementary roles. 
							This means that notifications generated by one application can be reused by a completely different application, accessed via the store where the notification data resides, through shared Linked Data vocabularies.</p>

                            <p>LDN is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Candidate Recommendation</a> of the W3C.</p>

                            <p>In this article we present use cases for decentralised notifications from the Social Web and related domains, and describe the requirements which guided the development of the protocol. 
							We discuss related work in terms of predecessors to this work, comparisons with current alternative approaches, as well as complementary protocols which can work alongside LDN. 
							We summarise the protocol itself, and then go into detail about specific architectural considerations that were made. We built a test suite which can be used to confirm that implementations conform with the specification, and we describe the independent implementations which interoperate with each other so far.</p>

                            <p>The high level use case is to have independently built applications to be able to generate and make use of notification data no matter how it was created or where it is stored. 
							Here we briefly discuss some of the use cases from different domains that can make use of Linked Data Notifications.</p>

                            <p><strong>Social</strong>: Announcements of new status updates and blog posts from contacts can be delivered through notifications; private and public personal messages; new comments or annotations on content, as well as likes, shares, and bookmarks; invitations to events and RSVPs; moves in a game; or collaborative content creation updates.
							In particular for connecting different social networks or for realising a fully decentralised social network, standardised and semantically represented notifications are absolutely essential.</p>

                            <p><strong>Scholarly Communication</strong>: Academic articles, scientific reports, and their peer-reviews can be published online. 
							Notifications can inform the author of an academic article or the scientific community about a new review or contribution. 
							For example, the notification can contain a concise description about what was reviewed and where the source can be found, when it was created, by whom, and the conditions under which it can be reused.
							Another use case for scholarly articles would be to notify an author when their work has been cited, in order to provide the means to build bidirectional connections between ideas, discoveries, and innovations, as well as their evolution.</p>

                            <p><strong>Change of State</strong>: Notifications can be used to capture provenance and state changes. 
							For instance, datasets have changesets which include deltas between resources; software or collaborative documents have versioning; applications detect dataset issues and recommend fixes; emergency broadcasts are made during disaster situations; weather forecasts; personal fitness progress; or scientific, experimental and statistical observations.
							For example, notifications can be used to disseminate scientific observations captured by systems, devices or sensors (e.g. telescope imagery, weather data) in a tailored and targeted manner to interested peer researchers. 
							Applications can customise the notification to contain a small, semantically represented unit of information capturing in particular the time and state of an event.</p>

                                    <p>Here we review previous and ongoing efforts towards delivering notifications in a decentralised manner. Since many systems which make use of notifications operate either in a completely centralised way, or are decentralised only in the sense that different instances of the <em>same</em> codebase need to interoperate, there appears to be limited work to review.</p>

                                    <p>The contents of a notification is one of either: 1) URLs, indicating relations between Web resources, or 2) a 'fat ping' containing a blob of information. Semantic Pingback, Webmention, and Provenance Pingback follow the first form, and are also known as <cite>linkbacks</cite>, the suite of protocols that essentially allows Web documents to manually and automatically link to or mention one another. This has the advantage that a verification mechanism can be tightly specified (the URL of the target must appear in the content of the source), but the disadvantage that notifications are only available for the use case of a link being published on the Web.</p>

                                    <p id="semantic-pingback-and-webmention"><strong>Semantic Pingback</strong> [<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~auer/publication/SemanticPingback.pdf"></a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Pingback&amp;oldid=57876"></a>, <a href="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj201_4.pdf"></a>, <a href="http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2016/papers/LDOW2016_paper_02.pdf"></a>] and <strong>Webmention</strong> [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention"></a>] both update the original Pingback [<a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback"></a>] mechanism by replacing the XML-RPC transport mechanism by a <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> request with two parameters (<code>source</code> and <code>target</code>). Resources which are the target for a notification advertise the respective receiving service or endpoint via a <code>Link</code> relation, either in HTTP headers or HTML. Semantic Pingback additionally enables discovery of the Pingback service where target is available as RDF. While the content at source may indicate (in any convention or serialisation format) the type of relation between the source and target URLs, this information about the relation is not transmitted to the receiver's endpoint; only the source and target URLs are sent. As such, there is also no way to distinguish between multiple potential mentions of the target at the source; this is left up to the receiver to interpret. Semantic Pingback does encourage generation of additional semantics about the relation(s) between the source and the target by processing the source as RDF if possible, and also defines specific ways for a receiving server to handle incoming pingback data in order to add the source data to an RDF knowledge base [<a href="https://aksw.github.io/SemanticPingback/"></a>]. Beyond verifying that the source does indeed contain the URL of the target, Webmention does not specify any further requirements of the receiving server; nor is it expected that "mentions" are retrievable once they have been sent. </p>

                                    <p id="provenance-pingback">A <strong>Provenance Pingback</strong> endpoint is also advertised through an HTTP <code>Link</code> header, and accepts a list of URIs for provenance records describing uses of the resource [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-aq/#provenance-pingback"></a>]. Provenance Pingback does not specify any further behaviour by the receiving server, but the contents at the URIs listed in the notification body are well-defined.</p>

                                    <p>There are also notification mechanisms which send more information than just URLs in the notification body; due to each mechanism's focused use case, the payload is restricted to a particular vocabulary.</p>

                                    <p><strong>DSNotify</strong> is a centralised service which crawls Linked Datasets and tracks changes to links (create, remove, move, update) with the specific use case of preserving link integrity between Linked Open Data resources. Notifications of changes are delivered to subscribers in the form of a specific XML payload [<a href="http://eprints.cs.univie.ac.at/81/1/2010_WWW_DSNotify.pdf"></a>, <a href="http://www.cibiv.at/~niko/dsnotify/"></a>]. Alternatively, with the <strong>sparqlPuSH</strong> service, users may input a SPARQL query, the results of which are the specific updates they are interested in. The query is run periodically by the service, and the results are converted to an XML feed, which is sent to a PubSubHubbub hub to which the user can subscribe [<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-699/Paper6.pdf"></a>]. The <strong>ResourceSync Change Notification</strong> specification also sends update notifications via a PubSubHubbub hub, this time with an XML payload based on the Sitemap format [<a class="ref" href="http://www.openarchives.org/rs/notification/1.0/notification"></a>].</p>

                                    <p>Each of these are notification mechanisms triggered by subscription requests. That is, a user must actively solicit messages from a particular service, rather than having a way for a service to select a notification target and autonomously discover where to send notifications to.</p>

                            <p>In this section we discuss some considerations for a Web notification protocol that conforms to the Linked Data design principles, as well as best practices for applications. 
							We use the considerations for establishing concrete requirements for the protocol in order to ensure interoperable application behaviour and consistent notification data exchange.</p>

                                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
									<p>In order to encourage modularity of applications, it is important to separate concerns and differentiate between different classes of implementation of the protocol. 
									Two parties are involved in the creation of a notification: a <em>sender</em> which generates the notification data, and a <em>receiver</em> which stores the created resource. 
									For notifications to be reused, we also have the role of a <em>consumer</em>, which reads the data of the notification and repurposes it in some way.
									A software implementation can of course play two or all three of these roles; the important part is that it need not. 
									A consuming application can read and use notification data without being concerned about ever sending or storing notifications itself.</p>
                                    <p>We deem a <em>RESTful architecture</em> [<a class="ref" href=""></a>] compatible with the <em>Linked Data Platform</em> (LDP) specification [<a class="ref" href=""></a>] to be a prerequisite. 
                                    REST is well suited for notifications, as it involves organisation of atomic resources, their discovery and description, and a lightweight API for the <abbr title="create, read, update, and delete">CRUD</abbr> (create, read, update, and delete) operations [<a href="http://ws-rest.org/2011/proc/a5-page.pdf">LD&amp;REST</a>].
                                    As such, notifications are considered resources in their own right, with their own dereferencable URIs.
                                    A further advantage is that existing LDP servers can be used to store notifications, as new notifications can be created in a <code>Container</code> in exactly the same way as any other resource.</p>

                                    <p>Linked Data applications benefit from domain-driven designs; that is, contributions and changes being small and focussed on a particular purpose, rather than generic or catch-all. 
									We do not purport to be able to design a notifications ontology which is appropriate for every domain, and so we consider the contents of a notification to be <em>application specific</em>. 
									We derive two core principles:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>a notification can contain arbitrary data,</li>
                                        <li>a notification is vocabulary agnostic.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Interoperability between different applications occurs through vocabulary reuse, and shared understanding of terms. 
									This is in accordance with Linked Data principles in general. 
									The practical upshot of this is that a calendar application which consumes event invitations which use the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfcal/">RDF Calendar</a></cite> is likely to completely ignore notifications containing the <cite><a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a></cite> vocabulary, even if it finds them all stored in the same place.
									For two independent applications operating in the <em>same</em> domain, a shared understanding of appropriate vocabulary terms is assumed.</p>

                                    <p>A possible filtering mechanism is rejecting notifications which do not match a specific pattern in their contents, or the <em>shape</em> of the data, in order to allow a certain class of applications consume them.
                                    For example, if the Inbox owner knows that they will only ever use a consuming application which processes friend requests, they can configure their receiver to filter out anything that doesn't match the pattern for a friend request, helping their consumer to be more efficient.
                                    If the notification constraints are also advertised by the receiving service as structured descriptions, generation and consumption of the notifications can be further automated.
                                    This can also be implemented as an anti-spam or abuse prevention measure.

                                    <p>Receivers may wish to filter notifications by verifying the sender, through for example a whitelist or a web of trust. 
									This requires an authentication mechanism and since different authentication mechanisms are appropriate for different applications, the notification protocol should ideally be usable alongside various methods such as clientside certificates (e.g. WebID+TLS), token-based (e.g. OAuth 2.0), or digital signatures. 
                                    A receiver which expects senders or consumers to authenticate requires additional security considerations.
									For example, it should check the validity of their credentials before returning any other data, including other error codes, and authentication involving token passing must be done over HTTPS.</p>

                                    <p>As <q>anyone can say anything about anything</q> another option is to dereference any external resources referred to in the notification contents, and cross-check against authoritative sources.

                                    <p>Applications may require that new notifications are pushed to them in real-time, or to request them at appropriate intervals. 
									To take this into account, we expand our definition of senders, receivers and consumers with the following interaction expectations: </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Notifications are <em>pushed</em> from senders to receivers;</li>

                                    <p>Thus, an application which offers an endpoint or callback URL to which notifications should be sent directly is a receiver, and an application which fetches notifications from an endpoint on its own schedule is a consumer.
									In certain scenarios, a receiver may wish to subscribe to a sender; for this, an existing subscription mechanism such as WebSub (formerly PubSubHubbub), the WebSocket Protocol, or HTTP Web Push can be used.</p>

									We need to consider both the needs of software systems and humans when large amounts of notification data are being generated and shared between diverse applications which may be operating without knowledge of each other. 
									Applications may additionally benefit from referring to or reusing notifications if the notifications are known to be available in the long term, or indicate their expected lifespan [<a href="http://philarcher.org/diary/2013/uripersistence/"></a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers" title="Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets"></a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089"></a>].</p>

                                    <p>Whilst being able to handle data irrespective of the particular RDF serialisation permits some flexibility, this can be costly to support. 
									From the perspective of the protocol design, we must take into account:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>application interoperability,</li>
                                        <li>maintenance of the RDF parsers and serialisation libraries,</li>
                                        <li>complexity of their inclusion in applications,</li>
                                        <li>run-time efficiency.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>In order to address these issues, LDN requires all applications to create and understand the JSON-LD syntax, both for looking at the contents of Inbox as well as for individual notifications. 
                                    Choosing a single serialisation which implementations <em>must</em> work with is necessary for consistent interoperability, as well as keeping processing requirements or external dependencies of codebases minimal.
									JSON-LD is advantageous in being familiar for developers who are used to JSON-based APIs but not RDF [<a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/"></a>], and it is compatible with existing JSON libraries or in some cases native programming language data structures.
									Optionally, applications may perform content negotiation (receivers can expose <code>Accept-Post</code> headers for senders, and consumers can send <code>Accept</code> headers to receivers) in order to attempt to exchange different RDF serialisations if desired.</p>

                            <p>We highlight some social scholarly communication use cases with <cite><a href="https://dokie.li/">dokieli</a></cite> ‚Äì a clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions [<a href="http://csarven.ca/dokieli"></a>]. dokieli is a domain-specific application that uses LDN to send and consume notifications for various purposes:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>When a reader comments on a specific fragment of text in an article using dokieli, the application discovers the article's inbox and sends a notification about the annotation. dokieli also consumes notifications from this Inbox to fetch and display the annotation source data as marginalia (figure 2).</li>
                                <li>A reader can share a dokieli-enabled article with their contacts; dokieli discovers an Inbox for each contact's profile URL and sends a notification there (figure 3).</li>
                                <li>When editing an article, the author can add a citation. If an Inbox is discovered in the cited article, dokieli sends a notification there to indicate what part of the article was cited by whom and where. dokieli-enabled articles also consume citation notifications to display these metrics for the author and other readers (figure 4).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Notifications sent by dokieli can be reused by any consuming applications which recognise the vocabulary terms; similarly, dokieli can consume notifications that were sent by a different application. </p>

                            <p>Further social use cases are demonstrated by <a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/sloph">sloph</a>, a personal publishing and quantified self platform which acts as a node in a decentralised social network. When a new piece of content is created on the server, sloph performs discovery on URLs it finds as values of particular properties of the generated data (according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub">ActivityPub</a>; cf.¬†the <a href="#compatibility-with-existing-systems">Compatibility</a> section) as well as any URLs in the body of the content and sends notifications accordingly. For instance:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the user generates an ActivityStreams 2.0 <em>Like</em> activity on their server, sloph uses the <code>object</code> of the <em>Like</em> as the target for a notification. Since dokieli also uses the ActivityStreams 2.0 vocabulary for social interactions, if the target is a dokieli article, this <em>Like</em> will be displayed (figure 5).</li>
                                <li>If the user publishes a blog post containing a link, which may be semantically annotated to indicate the reason for linking, sloph sends a notification to any Inbox discovered at that link.</li>
                                <li>As a receiver, sloph accepts all incoming notifications, but holds for moderation (ie. places behind access control) any that it cannot automatically verify refer to third-party content published on another domain. If an article written with dokieli publishes a citation of a blog post which advertises a sloph Inbox, sloph will fetch the article and verify whether the relation matches the contents of the notification before exposing the notification for re-use.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><a href="http://www.linkededitrules.org/">Linked Edit Rules</a> and <a href="https://melvincarvalho.github.io/vocab/">Solid Words</a> are specialised senders. Linked Edit Rules checks the consistency of statistical datasets against structured constraints, and delivers the consistency report as a notification to the user. Solid Words is a clientside game for learning new words in a foreign language; it delivers the player's score for each round to their Inbox. <a href="https://apps.rhiaro.co.uk/onscreen">OnScreen</a> is a (crude) generic consumer; as such, it can display notifications sent by both of the aforementioned senders (figure 6).</p>

                                    <p>We intentionally take a bare minimum approach, preferring to suggest using LDN alongside other existing protocols and standards rather than re-specifying already standardised mechanisms for non-core behaviours.

Standalone implementations of LDN are also straightforward, as a result. For example:</p>

                                        <li>An Inbox can double as a <cite><a href="http://www.webhooks.org/">Webhooks</a></cite> callback URL, in order to request notifications from applications which post JSON-based payloads (used by sloph).</li>
                                        <li><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a></cite> specialises LDN sending with the <em>ActivityStreams 2.0</em> vocabulary for notification contents, as well as specifies additional behaviour for a receiver upon receiving notifications with particular contents in order to organise and distribute interactions within a social network (used by sloph, and LDN is referenced directly by the ActivityPub specification).</li>
                                        <li><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">SHACL</a><cite>/<cite><a href="https://shexspec.github.io/spec/">ShEx</a></cite></cite> can be used to define the constraints of notification shape.</li>

                                  <p>We discuss the complexity of implementing LDN in terms of the number of HTTP requests it takes to implement a basic operation.  Sending a notification requires <span class="todo">#</span> distinct types of HTTP requests to <span class="todo">#</span> distinct types of resources, receiving requires <span class="todo">#</span> requests to <span class="todo">#</span> distinct types of resources, and consuming requires  <span class="todo">#</span> requests to <span class="todo">#</span> distinct types of resources.  <span class="todo">The previous could also be visualised as a table.</span></p>

                                    <p><span class="todo">As a transition from the above to this specific ‚ÄúHEAD‚Äù discussion, say which of the above operations normally require a HEAD request.</span>  Allowing the possibility of discovering an Inbox through <code>HTTP HEAD</code> or <code>Link</code> header is a pragmatic approach with optimisation benefits.</p>

                                    <p>Allowing the possibility of discovering an Inbox through <code>HTTP HEAD</code> or <code>Link</code> header is a pragmatic approach with optimisation benefits.</p>

                                    <p>Given that <code>HTTP GET</code> headers provide the same information as <code>HTTP HEAD</code>, it is possible to omit the optional Inbox discovery via <code>HTTP HEAD</code>, as long as the Inbox can be discovered from the <code>Link</code> header or the body. This has the advantage of requiring applications to only make requests for and respond to <code>HTTP GET</code> requests, and thereby in a way simpler to implement and communicate with. However, one disadvantage is that the size of the entity-body is significant and puts a higher bandwidth requirement on applications to serve and consume, especially if only the <code>Link</code> header is of interest to discover the Inbox. Hence, <code>HTTP HEAD</code> is useful for optimisation reasons.</p>

                                    <p>In treating notifications as any other Linked Data resources, LDN follows the second approach but without constraint on the contained information. As such LDN can cover the uses cases of "A refers to B" (1), as well as "C has a specific relation to D, as well as E" and "The weather is fine today".</p>

                                    <p>The LDN protocol has the potential to disseminate lossless information. Without the need of extensions, notifications can contain content that is precise or conforming to receiver's constraints. This is in contrast to protocols like Semantic Pingback and Webmention, where while specific <em>statements</em> are made at the source, there is no definite way to distinguish between multiple statements with the same source and target, in relation to the original notification. The receiving endpoints eventually handle the source data at their own discretion.</p>

                                    <p><strong class="todo"></strong>: One other consideration here is with the use of the <code>Link</code> header itself, and whether that is appropriate, required or improves the protocol. Generally the separation of protocol and content level messages is important, and so the content in RDF should describe itself rather relying on HTTP headers. However, in the case of non-RDF resources, like binary formats, images, video, it is not possible to achieve this in the content body. Therefore, using the <code>Link</code> header makes it possible to advertise an Inbox for these type of resources. In cases where Website owners want to add an Inbox to their assets without having to individually updates their content (or headers), as well as if they do not have write access for the content, then the <code>Link</code> header makes this possible.</p>

Some LDN interactions can return content with natural language text, such as HTML fragments, or summary fields. Providing multiple language representations of each item might not be feasible in all circumstances. Implementations are encouraged to provide means of discovering the available languages and/or negotiating the language returned, such as using the HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header to negotiate and select the most appropriate language representation to send for a given request.</p>
