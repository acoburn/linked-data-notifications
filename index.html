                          <p>Web notifications are traditionally conceived as ephemeral things that disappear after transport (or at least are likely to). They effect things on the receiving end, but don't themselves have identification or enable reuse. This article describes the Linked Data Notifications (LDN) protocol which specifies how to find and consume notifications, as well as sending. Notifications themselves may have any shape and are vocabulary agnostic in order to allow for use in a range of different application domains. LDN supports a modular approach to creating and storing data, in particular a decoupling between applications and data storage. Thus, where senders, receivers and consumers of notifications are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, this protocol allows them to seamlessly work together. The technical specification of LDN is part of the W3C Recommendation Track: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a>. The canonical URI of this article is http://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications</p>

                          <p>Note: why is it interesting or preferable to have persistent notification.. what new applications or class of applications does it enable? trust (checksum?)?</p>

                          <p>Note: why is it good to have decoupling between applications and data. From an application (end-users) perspective is it better? Is there an immediate benefit for end-users? Data ownership?</p>

They effect things on the receiving end, but don't themselves have identification or enable reuse. Hence, the process of creating and storing data is closely coupled with applications and storage mechanisms. Such system architectures limit applications to behave in a centralised manner where the data is subject to being part of an  information silo.</span></p>

                            <p about="" id="motivation" rel="schema:hasPart"><span about="#motivation" property="schema:description" typeof="deo:Motivation">We content that the data on the Web should not be locked in to particular systems or be only readable by the applications which created it. Users should be free to switch between applications and share data between them. This is one of the aspirations for enabling decentralised applications on the Web, and data reuse. </span></p>

The notion of a notification as an individual entity with its own URI is usually .

For instance, applications generate notifications about activities, interactions, and new information, which may be presented to the user or processed further.

                            <p><dfn id="ldn">Linked Data Notifications (<abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>)</dfn> supports sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated. This allows for more modular systems, which decouple data storage from the applications which display or otherwise make use of the data. The protocol is intended to allow senders, receivers and consumers of notifications, which are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, to seamlessly work together, contributing to decentralisation of our interactions on the Web.</p>

<p>LDN is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.</p>

Different applications using the same data; not being locked to a particular application to consume the data

<p>We support a range of different application domains, social and otherwise, thus the contents of notifications are left up to applications to define..</p>

                                    <p>The Webmention protocol is used to notify that content at the source URL includes the target URL <em>string</em> to the receiver of a Webmention endpoint.</p>

                                    <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/#sender-notifies-receiver">
                                        <p>The sender <strong class="rfc2119">MUST</strong> post <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> [<cite>HTML5</cite>] <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> parameters to the Webmention endpoint, where <code>source</code> is the URL of the sender's page containing a link, and <code>target</code> is the URL of the page being linked to.</p>

                                    <p>Webmention does not define the notion of an entity that is accessible at an URL for the mention itself. The mention is only intended for the receiver to process. There are no syntactical restrictions set on the content of the source URL, e.g., it can be plain-text, HTML, JSON, or a binary file, therefore it is effectively foremost about the source URL containing the target URL as a string.</p>

                                    <p id="webmention-workflow">A Webmention workflow is as follows: 1) Alice has an article in-reply-to Bob's article, 2) Bob's Webmention endpoint is discovered to deliver a mention, 3) a Webmention is sent to Bob's endpoint indicating that Alice's <em>mentions</em> Bob's article.</p>

                                    <p id="webmention-scope-and-approach"><strong>Scope and Approach</strong>: The <em>source</em> URL is the most essential component since it identifies the origin of the claim and where to locate it. Since the information that is provided in the <code>POST</code> is only a claim, it may or may not be of interest to the receiver, and the receiver makes no promise to do anything with it e.g., displaying.</p>

                                    <p>The <em>target</em> URL is used for the purpose of optimisation, i.e., making it easier for the recipient to find the target URL string at the source URL. The target URL is also used to allow external (third-party) services to help site owners without a Webmention endpoint.</p>

                                    <p id="webmention-analysis"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Verification of Webmention claims in source formats that's in plain-text or binary are ambiguous due to unspecified characteristic of where an URL string starts and ends. Hence, exact matching the string URL is not deterministic as there may be partial matches which are false positives. For structured formats like HTML and JSON, it has inherent limitations given that:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>While the content at source may indicate (in any convention or serialisation format) the type of relation between the source and target URLs, the information about the relation is not transmitted to the receiver's endpoint. Hence, the receiver implementation <em>interprets</em> the relation (or lack of) between the source and the target. The untyped relation is interpreted as a generic <em>mention</em> by default.</li>

                                        <li>If the source URL contains multiple mentions of the target URL, the Webmention endpoint is not informed about the particular instance. Therefore, the receiver is required to process the whole document and base its verification on the existence of one of those mentions. This sets forth an indeterministic verification step since there is no clear way to distinguish the received Webmention at the endpoint from multiple mentions which can exist at the source.</li>

                            <p><dfn id="ldn">Linked Data Notifications (<abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>)</dfn> is a protocol that describes how servers (receivers) can have messages pushed to them by applications (senders), as well as how other applications (consumers) may retrieve those messages. Any resource can advertise a receiving endpoint (Inbox) for the messages. Messages are expressed in RDF, and can contain any data.</p>

                            <p>LDN is a specialized use of Linked Data Platform [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ldp">LDP</a></cite>] for sending and consuming notifications. It is not dependent on a complete implementation of LDP, but an easy-to-implement subset. LDN is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn">W3C Recommendation</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ldn">LDN</a></cite>]</p>

                            <p>The LDN protocol supports a modular approach to creating and storing data, in particular a decoupling between applications and data storage. Thus, where senders, receivers and consumers of notifications are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, this protocol allows them to seamlessly work together.</p>

                                <li>This specification deliberately does not define the vocabulary of the notification contents in order to allow for use in a range of different application domains.</li>
                                <li>Authentication and verification of notifications is encouraged, but the mechanism to do so is at the discretion of receivers and consumers, as needs differ according to types of notification and different application domains.</li>

                                    <p>A sender is triggered, either by a human or an automatic process, to deliver a notification to a server. The notification is data intended for the attention of the receiver, for example: a personal message from a friend; a pingback link; a comment on a blog post; an invitation to collaborate; a calendar reminder; a scientific observation.</p>

                                    <p>The sender chooses a target resource to send notifications to; the sender then discovers the location of the target‚Äôs <em>Inbox</em>, and sends the notification there. Any resource can advertise an Inbox. The receiver exposes the notification data (according to appropriate access control) for use by consumers.</p>

                                    <p>Consumers discover the location of the Inbox in the same way as the sender, and may perform further processing on the notifications, combine it with some other data, or simply present it in a suitable human-readable way.</p>

                            <p>Inboxes are repositories for notifications.</p>

                            <p>Notifications are intended to announce social interactions and data.</p>

                            <p>The contents of a notification is application specific. We derive two core principles from this:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>a notification can contain arbitrary data</li>
                                <li>a notification is vocabulary agnostic</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Notifications are resources with their own URIs... (not ephemeral)</p>
